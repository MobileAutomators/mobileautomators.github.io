New meetup, new community - NEW SITE!

### Why do we need a site?

Meetup.com takes care of the whole event angle and that's not what it's all about. It's also about the talks, videos and slides and anything else we feel we need. This is the place to do it in.

Meetup's UI and stying are very lacking IMO and I want to give it more of a personal touch. To feel the vibe.

Yeah yeah I know, it's no there yet. I'm on it.

### The code

Built with [jekyll] on top of the [solid theme][solid] and deployed to Github Pages at [mobileautomators.github.io][repo]. The "mobileautomators.com" DNS records point to it.

Why like this? It's free hosting baby AND promotes code contirbution.

### Contiribute your code and content

Found a bug? Wanna add a feature / page / post? (talk to me first).

Here's how to set it up:

1. Install jekyll `gem install jekyll`
2. [Fork the repo][repo].
3. Clone it `git clone YOUR_FORK`
4. Run `jekyll serve` from the directory
5. Browse to [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
