New meetup, new community - new site!

### Why do we need a site?

It's true that meetup.com gives everything related to the meetups. But it's not all about the events - it's also about the talks, the videos, the slides and whatever we see fit. This is our true home.

### Under the hood

Built with [jekyll] and the [solid theme][solid] and deployed to Github Pages.
Which means it's open source! Wanna contirbute?
Here's how to set it up:
<!--more-->

1. Install jekyll `gem install jekyll`
2. [Fork the repo][repo].
3. Clone it `git clone YOUR_FORK`
4. Run `jekyll serve` from the directory
5. Browse to [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

Then, change whatever you see fit and send me a pull request. Ezpz!
